The trade selector recommendation system was build using a two states Bayesian network with sequential markov chains. The biggest chalange here is that the trades not always start with the same letter as what the user inputs.

The first step will be to identify if the trade that the user is looking for really starts with the letter that was typed.

Example - Body Artist  - Tattoo Artist 

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
